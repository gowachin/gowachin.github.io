I'm fond of __Evolution__ of Life and an __ecology__ enthusiast.  
I'm secretary of [Guepe](https://www.facebook.com/associationguepe/), an association for sharing naturalist information all around Grenoble.
You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/gowachin) as \@gowachin.


### Current work

I am a student in __Ecology__ and __Evolution__ in Grenoble.

I'm interested biogeography of species and ecosystems, and how environnement drive this througt time.


### Hometown -- Education

It's difficult to say where I'm from, as I lived in [Briançon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%C3%A7on), [Nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice), [La Réunion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union) and lately [Grenoble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble). France.
I naturally love trips and have seen a lot of stuff around the world.

I've done all my graduates studies at the [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/), in __biology__, __geology__ and __ecology__.
This studies were linked with multiple internships at the [LECA](https://leca.osug.fr/).
