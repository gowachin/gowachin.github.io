I'm fond of __Evolution__ of Life and an ecology enthusiast. 
This got me __addicted to R__ and package programming.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/gowachin) as \@gowachin.

### Current work

I am an R __modelling engineer__ within the [UMR AMURE](https://www.umr-amure.fr/) at IFREMER Brest.

I'm interested in biogeography of species and population dynamics, and how environnement drive this througt time.


### Hometown -- Education

It's difficult to say where I'm from, as I lived in [Briançon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%C3%A7on), [Nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice), [La Réunion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union),  [Grenoble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble) and lately [Brest](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brest) in France.
I naturally love trips and have seen a lot of stuff around the world.
Living close to the sea and the mountains, I do a lot of outdoor activities like trekking and diving.

I've done all my graduates studies at the [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/), in __biology__, __geology__ and __ecology__.
This studies were linked with multiple internships at the [LECA](https://leca.osug.fr/). 

I was secretary of [Guepe](https://www.facebook.com/associationguepe/), an association for sharing naturalist information all around Grenoble and R skills.
